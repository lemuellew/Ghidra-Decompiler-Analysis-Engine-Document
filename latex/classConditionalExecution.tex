\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A class for simplifying a series of conditionally executed statements. 

This class tries to perform transformations like the following\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a) \{           \textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   BODY1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}          ==>       BODY1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a) \{             BODY2}
\DoxyCodeLine{   BODY2}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}                  \}}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Other similar configurations where two C\+B\+R\+A\+N\+C\+Hs are based on the same condition are handled. The main variation, referred to as a {\bfseries{directsplit}} in the code looks like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a) \{                      \textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a \&\& new\_boolean()) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   a = new\_boolean();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}                      ==>      BODY1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (a) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{   BODY1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}                             \}}
\end{DoxyCode}
 The value of \textquotesingle{}a\textquotesingle{} doesn\textquotesingle{}t need to be reevaluated if it is false.

In the first scenario, there is a block where two flows come together but don\textquotesingle{}t need to, as the evaluation of the boolean is redundant. This block is the {\bfseries{iblock}}. The original evaluation of the boolean occurs in {\bfseries{initblock}}. There are two paths from here to {\bfseries{iblock}}, called the {\bfseries{prea}} path and {\bfseries{preb}} path, either of which may contain additional 1in/1out blocks. There are also two paths out of {\bfseries{iblock}}, {\bfseries{posta}}, and {\bfseries{postb}}. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classConditionalExecution}{Conditional\+Execution}} class determines if the C\+B\+R\+A\+N\+CH in {\bfseries{iblock}} is redundant by determining if the boolean value is either the same as, or the complement of, the boolean value in {\bfseries{initblock}}. If the C\+B\+R\+A\+N\+CH is redundant, {\bfseries{iblock}} is removed, linking {\bfseries{prea}} to {\bfseries{posta}} and {\bfseries{preb}} to {\bfseries{postb}} (or vice versa depending on whether the booleans are complements of each other). If {\bfseries{iblock}} is to be removed, modifications to data-\/flow made by {\bfseries{iblock}} must be preserved. For M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+E\+Q\+U\+A\+Ls in {\bfseries{iblock}}, reads are examined to see if they came from the {\bfseries{posta}} path, or the {\bfseries{postb}} path, then the are replaced by the M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+E\+Q\+U\+AL slot corresponding to the matching {\bfseries{prea}} or {\bfseries{preb}} branch. If {\bfseries{posta}} and {\bfseries{postb}} merge at an {\bfseries{exitblock}}, the M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+E\+Q\+U\+AL must be pushed into the {\bfseries{exitblock}} and reads which can\textquotesingle{}t be attributed to the {\bfseries{posta}} or {\bfseries{postb}} path are replaced by the {\bfseries{exitblock}} M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+E\+Q\+U\+AL.

In theory, other operations performed in {\bfseries{iblock}} could be pushed into {\bfseries{exitblock}} if they are not read in the {\bfseries{posta}} or {\bfseries{postb}} paths, but currently non M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+E\+Q\+U\+AL operations in {\bfseries{iblock}} terminate the action.

In the second scenario, the boolean evaluated in {\bfseries{initblock}} remains unmodified along only one of the two paths out, {\bfseries{prea}} or {\bfseries{reb}}. The boolean in {\bfseries{iblock}} (modulo complementing) will evaluate in the same way. We define {\bfseries{posta}} as the path out of {\bfseries{iblock}} that will be followed by this unmodified path. The transform that needs to be made is to have the unmodified path out of {\bfseries{initblock}} flow immediately into the {\bfseries{posta}} path without having to reevalute the condition in {\bfseries{iblock}}. {\bfseries{iblock}} is not removed because flow from the \char`\"{}modified\char`\"{} path may also flow into {\bfseries{posta}}, depending on how the boolean was modified. Adjustments to data-\/flow are similar to the first scenario but slightly more complicated. The first block along the {\bfseries{posta}} path is referred to as the {\bfseries{posta\+\_\+block}}, this block will have a new block flowing into it.

Test for a modifiable configuration around the given block. 

The given block is tested as a possible {\bfseries{iblock}}. If this configuration works and is not a {\bfseries{directsplit}}, {\bfseries{true}} is returned. If the configuration works as a {\bfseries{directsplit}}, then recursively check that its {\bfseries{posta\+\_\+block}} works as an {\bfseries{iblock}}. If it does work, keep this {\bfseries{iblock}}, otherwise revert to the {\bfseries{directsplit}} configuration. In either case return {\bfseries{true}}. Processing the {\bfseries{directsplit}} first may prevent posta\+\_\+block from being an {\bfseries{iblock}}.
