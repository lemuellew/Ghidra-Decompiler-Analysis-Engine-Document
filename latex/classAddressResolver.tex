\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Abstract class for converting native constants to addresses. 

This class is used if there is a special calculation to get from a constant embedded in the code being analyzed to the actual \mbox{\hyperlink{classAddress}{Address}} being referred to. This is used especially in the case of a segmented architecture, where \char`\"{}near\char`\"{} pointers must be extended to a full address with implied segment information.

The main resolver method.

Given a native constant in a specific context, resolve what address is being referred to. The constant can be a partially encoded pointer, in which case the full pointer encoding is recovered as well as the address. Whether or not a pointer is partially encoded or not is determined by the {\itshape sz} parameter, indicating the number of bytes in the pointer. A value of -\/1 here indicates that the pointer is known to be a full encoding. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em val} & is constant to be resolved to an address \\
\hline
{\em sz} & is the size of {\itshape val} in context (or -\/1). \\
\hline
{\em point} & is the address at which this constant is being used \\
\hline
{\em full\+Encoding} & is used to hold the full pointer encoding if {\bfseries{val}} is a partial encoding \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
the resolved \mbox{\hyperlink{classAddress}{Address}} 
\end{DoxyReturn}
